# GitHub Gems: Driving Open-Source Investments With Data

## Important Metrics and Data Points 

This project aims to develop a data pipeline that allows users to gain deeper insight into the open-source ecosystem on 
Github. This way, the users can utilize the pipeline to inform any investment decisions they might try to make. 
The most important metrics that we want to look at with this pipeline are the growth of stars and the growth rate of commits for the repos 
available on GitHub. 

The data points available for this project are all going to be from GH Archive. This is chosen because the data on GH Archive will be 
updated hourly, and will provide ample data for a daily update. 

The data will be delivered in a SQL Database, and updated daily.
